##Group Maker 3000

#Creating New Cohorts
You have two options:
1. You can copy the sample_cohort.txt and fill in the lines with student names. Then run ruby group_maker.rb "***cloned_file_name.txt***"

-note: This will not update a cohort that was already created, and will ignore duplicate cohort names.

2. You can run group_maker.rb without any arguements and follow the console prompts.

#Caution - this initial version does not roll back groups once they are made, so
save the groups in a seperate system (email?) before making new groups.
